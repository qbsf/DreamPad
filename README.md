My website is an interactive soundboard with psychedelic visuals that change as you cycle through the sounds. Clicking on each of the buttons on the left of the screen will randomise between a selection of 5 gifs and audio samples per button. The intent is to let the user explore this dynamic soundscape finding unique grooves and patterns, while providing an interesting visual representation of what they are listening to. All of the sound files were produced by myself using the VST Serum and the DAW FL studio. 

The aesthetic and feel of the project is inspired by surrealist artwork and its counter pieces in electronic music, the gifs being reworked artefacts or elements from important historical surrealist paintings including the likes of Salvador Dali, Man Ray, Max Erst and many more. The music borrows lots of aspects from artists such as Aphex Twin, Leftfield and Autechre, who helped develop the electronic music scene and really brought it into the limelight. The dark and gritty style and theme intends to reflect upon and highlight the abrasive style of the music.

Taking this further I would like to expand on the directory of sounds and visuals available, and create a more dynamic display with more variation in everything. The next stage would be to synthesise some new sounds and create short melodies to add depth and complexity to the music, which would also open up my visual options. Another extension could be increasing the capabilities of the soundboard to enable the user to automate certain features themselves such as a slider controlling the cutoff or resonance of a bassline.
